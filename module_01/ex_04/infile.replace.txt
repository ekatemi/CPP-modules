[Verse 1]
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing l the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

[Chorus]
Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle l the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle l the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
